# üè† Homepage {.unnumbered}

This website serves as a digital companion for TJ students taking RS1, or any other TJ students who need a quick intro to data science. If you want to see what R is capable of, click "run code" below. Try it! It might take ~15 seconds to load.

## General Guidelines to Start {.unnumbered}

1.  Like mathematics, there are many different ways to get to the same point. The advantage of R is that it is easily accessible to everyone to learn, and easily accessible for everyone to develop. It is easy for someone to code and publish their own approach to a problem.

    a.  This turns out to be both a blessing and a curse. We offer *one* way to clean your data, run a t-test, etc. **Chances are that, if you google your problem, you will find someone with completely different code. That's okay.**

    b.  In fact, we actively encourage you to find different ways of doing code, if it makes sense to you. R is a vast, wide, universe. Go out there and explore.

2.  **Three Before Me Rule:** If you encounter a problem you are expected to ask three people before you ask your teacher. Some people you can ask are:

    -   Google (Stack Overflow).

    -   A friend.

    -   The search bar in the textbook.

    -   Another friend. An older student. Your brother. Heck, even your parents.

Now that we have talked about summarizing data, let's talk about visualizing it.

## Histograms

You can use the built-in `hist()` function in order to create histograms, very easily. Below, I will graph the `TAVG`, average temperature, from the `dca_weather` dataset in February, when `month` equals 2.

```{r}
feb_temps<- dca_weather$TAVG[dca_weather$month %in% 2]
hist(feb_temps, 
     col= "skyblue", 
     main= "Average Daily Temperature at DCA in February 2022", 
     xlab= "Temperature (Fahrenheit)", 
     ylab="Number of Days")
```

When we use any plotting function in R, we always pass some extra commands to customize the chart called a **parameter**.

You can type all the parameters in a single line, but it is usually cleaner to make a new line for each parameter. As long as you follow each parameter with a comma `,` and the parameters are all inside the parentheses `()` of your plot command, you will be OK.

### Graphical Parameters

Here's a breakdown of the parameters in the histogram above:

-   `col`: Sets the color of the graphic elements. [Here's a list of colors that you can pick from in R](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)
-   `main`: Sets the main title of the graph.
-   `xlab`: Sets the x-axis label. Always include units!
-   `ylab`: Sets the y-axis label. Always include context!

## Histogram Exercise

**Your turn!** In the box below is a histogram of march_temps at DCA. Label the graph appropriately, and change the color to `darkseagreen4`.

## Dotplots

Unfortunately, there's no built in function to create dotplots in R. We have to repurpose the `stripchart` command in order to make something closest to a dotplot.

First, I will store  `TAVG`, average temperature, from the `dca_weather` dataset in June, when `month` equals 6. I will save this data into a variable called `june_temps`.

```{r}
june_temps<- dca_weather$TAVG[dca_weather$month %in% 6]
```

Here's the code for creating a dotplot. Notice that `june_temps` is actually a vector (a list of many numbers). 

```{r}
stripchart(june_temps, method = "stack", 
           offset = .5, 
           at = 0, 
           pch = 19,
           col = "steelblue", 
           main = "Average June Temperatures at DCA", 
           xlab = "Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
```

As before, you pass several parameters into `stripchart()`. You can safely ignore `stack=`, `offset=`, and `at=`. Just include them, any time you need a dotplot.

`pch=` is a parameter that you can feel free to modify. It specifies the style of each dot. For a list of different dot styles you can use, [click here.](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r)

## Boxplots

### Single Boxplots

Let's start off with the most simple case: making one boxplot with one variable. I'll make a boxplot of June Temperatures in DCA:

```{r}
boxplot(june_temps,
        col="pink",
        main= "Boxplot of June Temperatures at DCA Airport",
        xlab= "Temperature (Fahrenheit)",
        horizontal= TRUE)
```

By default, the `boxplot()` command will create boxplots in the vertical orientation (more on this later). If you want to have the boxplots become horizontal, set the `horizontal=` parameter to `TRUE`.

### Grouped Boxplots {#grouped-boxplots}

Normally, you don't just make one boxplot, but several boxplots to compare variance *within groups*. To do this, we have to give the `boxplot()` command a second **grouping variable**, which we indicate with the `~` operator.

Usually, both the variable you want to graph and the variable you want to group by are in the same dataset, so we specify it with the `data=` parameter. Below are the bosplots for `TAVG` with the `dca_weather` dataset, grouped by `month`.

```{r}
boxplot(TAVG~month, data=dca_weather,
        col="skyblue",
        main= "Daily Average Temperatures at DCA Airport, by Month",
        xlab= "Month",
        ylab="Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
```

The `~` variable effectively tells R which axis to to place each variable in, based on `y~x`. In other words, since the first variable is `TAVG`, that goes on the y-axis, and `month` goes on the x-axis. We have effectively set `month` as our grouping variable.

Look at what happens when you switch the axes around:

```{r}
boxplot(month~TAVG, data=dca_weather)
```

Yep. It's not pretty. Be careful of which variable goes where.

### Customizing `boxplot()`

Here's an idea of the things you can do with boxplots:

```{r}
boxplot(TAVG~month, data=dca_weather,
        col=c("skyblue", "darkcyan", "cadetblue1", "chartreuse", "forestgreen", "darkorange"),
        main= "Daily Average Temperatures at DCA Airport, by Month",
        xlab= "Month",
        ylab="Temperature (Fahrenheit)",
        names=c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"))
```

-   In our original graph, `Months` were labeled as their numbers. If you want to give custom names for each group, use the `names=` parameter. Remember to set the `names=` parameter to a vector equal to the number of boxplots there are, otherwise, R will return an error.
-   If you want to give your boxplots different colors, set `col=` to a character vector of color names. Remember the length of this vector also needs to be equal to the number of boxplots.
- R automatically calculates what the appropriate x and y axes values are. If you want to change them, specify an `xlim=` and `ylim=` parameter. Each parameter should take the form of `c(min, max)`, where min and max are the numeric values for the start of the axis and the end of the axis, respectively.

## Boxplot Exercise

**Your turn!** The following boxplot was supposed to graph the `PRCP` variable (representing amount of snow/rainfall in inches), grouped by `month`, but is completely messed up. Fix it so that:

-   You graph `PRCP`, grouped by `month`
-   You have an appropriate main title, x-axis, and y-axis labels
-   The "Months" are labeled as "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", etc. etc.
-   You add some pretty colors to your boxplots.
-   You have a y-axis that goes from 0 to 100.

## Exporting your graphs

You can find your plots under the **Plots** tab in the lower right.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/07-Visualizing-Data/plots_tab.png") 
```

There are a couple of ways to export your graphs in RStudio.

1.  Right click on the plot, and select *"Save Image As"*, or *"Copy to Clipboard"*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/07-Visualizing-Data/plots_tab_right_click.png") 
```

2.  Click on Export on the top, and then click *"Save As Image"*, or *"Copy to Clipboard"*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/07-Visualizing-Data/plots_tab_export.png") 
```

### Blurry Graphs?

Blurry graphs happen because your plot window is too small. For some reason, it hapens more on the FCPS provided computers than on personal laptops. To fix:

1.  Under the plots tab, click **"Zoom"**. A new window will pop open.
2.  This window will have a larger version of your graph. Use the right click method to save your graph.

## More graphing options 

### Using `par()`

If you run `par()` before the command for any graph, you can stack multiple graphs into the same window. Here's an example:

<iframe style="margin:0 auto; min-width: 100%;" id="ch6-par-ex" class="interactive" src="https://kaisamng.shinyapps.io/Ch7_par_Example/" scrolling="no" frameborder="no">

</iframe>

Switch the `1` and `2` around in the `mfrow=` parameter so it says `par(mfrow=c(2,1))`. Then, rerun the code. What happens?

As you can see, passing the `mfrow=` parameter allows you to stack multiple graphs based on the a certain number of rows and columns. This will be helpful, especially when you have multiple graphs of the same variable.


### Overlaying a five number summary onto a boxplot

Every graph in R can be thought of as a layer-- if you want to add anything on top of your graph, it is represented as a subsequent call after your plot command. 

For example, if I wanted to overlay a five number summary on top of each part of the boxplot, I run the `text()` command. Inside the text command, I tell R what `labels=` to place, and at which `x=` value they should be placed at. 

```{r}
boxplot(june_temps,
        col="pink",
        main= "Boxplot of June Temperatures at DCA Airport",
        xlab= "Temperature (Fahrenheit)",
        horizontal= TRUE)
text(labels=fivenum(june_temps), x=fivenum(june_temps),  y=1.3)
```
